While the final number may vary, we assure you it will be more than 101. Concerning cell samples, there are two distinct experiments?Exp1 designed as 2X2, and Exp2 designed as 2X3. Despite their differences, we request both cell experiments to be prepared and detected in the same batch for potential future raw data analysis. For analysis, please analyze the two separately. Plasma samples involve three experiments (Exp3 and Exp5 designed as 2X2, and Exp4 with only one factor and three conditions).

Through efferocytosis, macrophages secrete a variety of factors that facilitate regeneration, and swiftly adapt their behavior in response to a range of physical and biological microenvironmental cues. To examine transcriptional changes in relation to efferocytosis, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on naive macrophages and efferocytic macrophages engulfing apoptotic osteoblasts. The scRNA-seq data consistently showed upregulation of glycolysis-associated genes in efferocytic macrophage clusters (also validated via qRT-PCR), indicating an enhancement of glycolytic pathways and a potential production of lactate in bone macrophages. Recent literature suggests shifts in metabolism and bioenergetics is associated with functional changes in macrophages, for instance increased glycolysis is linked with heightened inflammatory activity in macrophages. However, the efferocytosis-induced macrophage glycolysis has been recently associated with metabolic changes distinct from the glycolytic upregulation observed in inflammatory macrophages. In this context, it might accelerate the pro-resolving function of macrophages through a different mechanism. The aim of this experiment is to identify specific changes in bone macrophage metabolism induced by efferocytosis of apoptotic osteoblastic cells. To this end metabolic differences in macrophages cultured alone, macrophages co-cultured for 18h with apoptotic osteoblasts (1 AC per 1 macrophage), or apoptotic osteoblasts alone will be analyzed." experimentFile="Y:\DataAnalysis\MRC2ToolboxProjects\_CORE\EX01404-Energy-metabolism-in-18h-mac-effero-apopOB-\EX01404-Energy-metabolism-in-18h-mac-effero-apopOB-.caproject" dateCreated="2024-06-07 17:45:37" lastModified="2024-06-07 17:45:38" limsExperiment="EX01404" /><experimentPointer projectType="DATA_ANALYSIS" id="80ce9e87-ef14-41fa-ab4a-efd22fe893e6" name="EX01409 - BATCH01" description="MoTrPAC Human Post Suspension Tranche 1 EDTA plasma samples from shipment W20000960M" experimentFile="Y:\DataAnalysis\MRC2ToolboxProjects\_CORE\EX01409\EX01409-BATCH01\EX01409-BATCH01.caproject" dateCreated="2024-07-23 14:33:57" lastModified="2024-07-23 14:33:58" limsExperiment="EX01409" /><experimentPointer projectType="ID_TRACKER_DATA_ANALYSIS" id="IDX0257" name="EX01117-Heart-iDDA-POS-V2" description="Rerun of EX01117 (MoTrPAC) heart POS mode iDDA using Tracker data extraction" dateCreated="2024-02-21 15:12:30" lastModified="2024-02-21 15:12:30" limsExperiment="IDX0257" /><experimentPointer projectType="RAW_DATA_ANALYSIS" id="781a54bf-cf95-4365-bc34-259df4441358" name="EX00953-Heart-iDDA-POS-V2" description="Rerun of EX00953 (MoTrPAC) heart POS mode iDDA using Tracker data extraction" experimentFile="y:\dataanalysis\mrc2toolboxprojects\_idtracker\heart-v2\ex00953-heart-idda-pos-v2\ex00953-heart-idda-pos-v2.rdproject" dateCreated="2024-02-21 11:12:34" lastModified="2024-02-21 12:17:01" limsExperiment="IDX0255" createdBy="U00037" /><experimentPointer projectType="RAW_DATA_ANALYSIS" id="1970288d-c0a2-4ebb-b761-3baa4d8add25" name="EX00979-Liver-iDDA POS test" description="EX00979-Liver-iDDA positive mode test experiment" experimentFile="y:\dataanalysis\mrc2toolboxprojects\_idtracker\ex00979\ex00979-liver-idda-pos-test\ex00979-liver-idda-pos-test.rdproject" dateCreated="2023-02-08 19:07:40" lastModified="2023-04-19 12:49:31" createdBy="U00037" /></RecentExperiments></RecentObjects>
