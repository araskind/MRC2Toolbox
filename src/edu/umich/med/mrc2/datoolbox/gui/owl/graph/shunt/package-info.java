/**
 * <h2>OWL Shunt</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This package contains a simple (local, non-reasoned) graph model {@link owltools.graph.shunt.OWLShuntGraph} for disassembling an OWL (or any other kind of) graph
 * into a simplified form for dumping out into a JSON graph structure for consumption by BBOP-JS on the client. It includes a simple depth-first iterator and
 * simple ancestor and descendant (including closure) functions.
 * </p> 
 * 
 * <p>
 * See {@link owltools.graph.shunt.OWLShuntTest} and {@link owltools.graph.shunt.OWLShuntDFIteratorTest}
 * classes.
